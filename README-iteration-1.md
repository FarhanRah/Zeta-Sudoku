# **User Story #1**
As an **expert user of the application**, I want to be able to select which language would I like to learn through the home screen, so that I can broaden my language skills.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When the user clicks on the English button, the grid will be pre-filled with some of the English words and the French words will be added to the grid using the nine buttons (each representing a word). Vice-versa when the French button is clicked.

# **User Story #2**
As an **expert in English language and also the application**, I want to study some more complex and challenging French vocabulary so that I can improve my reading comprehension by concentrating on the bigger, more powerful words.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When the user clicks on a cell that belongs to the 5th row and 4th column, both the 5th row and the 4th column will be highlighted to bring users attention to them.

# **User Story #3**
As an **expert in English language but a novice user of the application**, I want to master some of the challenging French terminology as well as how to fill a cell inside a grid by utilizing the tips and tricks supplied on top of the user interface, by doing all this I would feel comfortable using the application without having any doubts in my mind.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When the user clicks on the cell that belongs to the 5th row and 4th column (initially pre-filled with "school"), and then clicks on the button that says "école", the cell that was initially clicked will be filled with the French translation of "school" which is "école".

# **User Story #4**
As an **expert in French language but a novice user of the application**, I want to learn some of the difficult English vocabulary and also learn what happens if I were to input an invalid value into the cell, by the helps of tips and tricks provided on the top of the user interface I will be able to prepare myself to take on harder sudoku boards and solve them easily.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When the user clicks on the cell that belongs to the 2nd row and 5th column (initially empty), and then clicks on the button that says "hey", the cell that was initially clicked will now be filled with both the English and French translation of "hey". However, since "hey" is already present in that row (on 2nd row and 2nd column), a pop-up (TOAST message) will be shown to the user, notifying them that the word chosen is already present and they should instead choose someother word.

# **User Story #5**
As a **user of the application**, I would like a concise summary of the game rules once the game ends and also the ability to return to home screen or play the game again, all these options would allow me to navigate the application without any difficulty.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When the user successfully ends the game by filling the whole grid, a pop-up (AlertDialog) will be shown to the user that quickly summarizes the game rules and also provides the user with "Play Again" button, if they wish to play again, or "Home" button, if they wish to return to home screen.
