# **User Stories for Iteration 2**
**Note:** User Stories for the previous iteration (Iteration 1) are located inside of [HERE](README-iteration-1.md).
## **User Story 1**
As a **teacher**, I want to add pairs of custom words, so that my students can practice them each week.
<br>
<br>
As a **student working with a textbook**, I want to load pairs of words from a chapter, this way I would be able to practice with words that I am interested in or required to learn.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user types an english and french word pair into their respective textbox, they can click the add button to store the word in a list of words which can be used for any sudoku session.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user adds 7 custom pairs of words and decides to run the game, they will be provided with a Toastbar message that would ask them to input 2 more pairs of words since the algorithm requires a minimum of 9 pairs to be inputted from the teacher before the game can be run.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user opens the application and clicks on "Upload Your Own Words" button, they can upload the PDF of a chapter they want the words to be extracted from, then the application will only provide the words that are part of the chapter.

## **User Story 2**
As a **student**, I want the Sudoku app to keep track of the vocabulary words that I am having difficulty recognizing so that they will be used more often in my practice puzzles.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user starts a game, the game will prioritize the words which the user has previously gotten wrong the most, to use for the game.

## **User Story 3**
As a **user of a small android device and an expert of the application**, I want a control bar on the top of the application, so that I can control my game within the application by using the back arrow, pause my game or change the background color of the application.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user of Samsung Galaxy S7 opens the application, and starts the game, they will be provided with a control bar on top that will include a pause button. If the user wants to continue playing the game later, they can simply click on the pause button and unpause it when they come back.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user with vision defects opens the application, they can easily click on the color changer on the top control bar to change the color to whatever suits their eyes and mood the best, for example they can change the color to black or grey to reduce the stress on their eyes.

## **User Story 4**
As a **student**, I want to be able to play the game using landscape orientation, so that I can see the words in large font and easily use the scroll bar on the right to move up or down.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user opens the application, they can change the orientation to landscape by rotating their phone and play the game with larger font, rather than playing the game on a smaller font on their phone. They can use the scroll bar present on the right side of the screen to scroll down and fully see the whole grid.

## **User Story 5**
As a **beginner to the language of French**, I want to learn French on a bigger display device such as a tablet, so that I can easily read all the words included in the grid.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user who is new to English opens the application on their Samsung Galaxy tablet, they will be able to play the game with bigger font for better clarity and readability, that way they would not struggle while learning English.
