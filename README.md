## **TDD Example 1**
**Example:** When the user clicks on "Upload Your Words" button on the main page, they will be taken to a new page where they could either select a list they have already added or simply add a new one. If the decide to add a new list, they could click on "Create New Word List" button and a new page will open where they can add all the words they wish to play with. In order to add a new pair of words, they simply have to fill in the English and French text field and then click on "+ Add" button. Once the user has added all the words, they can simply click on "Select List" and the game will now use their custom words.

## **TDD Example 2**
**Example:** When the user clicks on "Game Statistics" button on the main page, they will be taken to a new page where they will be shown the top 9 word pairs they have struggled with the most. Each word pair will be represented with an exact number of times they struggled with it. Based on these statistics, the user could decide to practice more on those words and improve their knowledge.

## **TDD Example 3**
**Example:** When the user clicks on "Start Your Game" button on the main page, they will be taken to a new configuration page, where they will be provided multiple options they could adjust for their game. The user will be provided the option to choose the grid size they wish to play with, the language they want to learn, whether the game should have listening comprehension or not and also the ability for the user to add custom words. If the user clicks on "9 x 9" grid, "English" as the language and then add a few custom words, the game will start with all these selected options.

## **TDD Example 4**
**Example:** When the user is playing the game, they will be provided with a control bar on the top. The control bar contains buttons to navigate around the application and have a greater control of their game. If the user clicks on the pause button, the game will pause (the timer on the top will also be paused) and the user can click on the play button to continue playing once they come back. If the user clicks on the color changer from the control bar, they will be provided with multiple colors they could choose for the background of the application. This option always the user to customize the game according to their likings. Lastly, if the user clicks on the back button, they will be taken back to the home page.

## **TDD Example 5**
**Example:** When the user is on the config page, they can choose different sized grids they wish to play on. Each sized grid (4 x 4, 6 x 6, 9 x 9, 12 x 12) has different level of difficulty. If the user decides to choose the listening comprehension mode, they simply have to check the listening comprehension checkbox next to "Language to Learn" section. If the user is an expert in the game, they could decide to choose 12 x 12 to test their knowledge. If they are new to the application, they could simply start with a 4 x 4 grid and advance to higher grid levels as their skill progresses.
