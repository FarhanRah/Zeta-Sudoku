## **User Story 1**
As a **beginner to French**, I want a configuration page before my game starts, so that I can choose all different options according to my personal liking.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user starts the game, they will be presented with a configuration page to choose the grid size, language they wish to learn and any custom words they would want to be added in to the game. These options will allow the user to tweak the game according to their own choice.

## **User Story 2**
As an **expert user of the application**, I want the ability to change the music played in the background or completely stop the music while playing the game, so that I do not get distracted from any other activities happening around me and completely have my focus in the game.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user starts playing the game, by default there will be a music running on the background, but by the help of the music button in our control bar, they can change the music to whatever they like the most or they can even completely stop the music from playing.

## **User Story 3**
As a **teacher of elementary and junior high school children**, I want scaled versions of Sudoku that use 4x4 and 6x6 grids, so that I can provide my students with sudoku games that suit their level of understanding.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a teacher starts the game they will be asked what grid size they would like. Based on the difficulty they want to set for the game, the teacher could choose one of the available grid sizes. If the student has no prior experience of sudoku, the teacher could potentially choose a 4x4 grid since it will be easier compare to the rest of the grids.

## **User Story 4**
As a **vocabulary learner who wants an extra challenging mode**, I want a 12x12 version of Sudoku to play on my tablet, so that I can improve my sudoku and language learning skills at a quicker pace.
<br>
<br>
**Example:** When a user using Samsung Galaxy tablet starts the game, they will have the option to choose 12x12 grid size. Since the screen size of their device is large, they will easily be able to accommodate a 12x12 grid on the screen and have fun playing a harder version of the game. Not only will 12x12 be harder, but there will be more unique vocabulary words they could learn.
